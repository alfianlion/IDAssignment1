## Design Process

The approach to the design of the website is to keep it minimal as possible. A **_minilistic look_** of course.

Having the thought in mind, I would like to make the website as interactive as possible with the Color Version Switcher for the website.

The desired goal for the users to achieve is to better understand me and the skills I have as it is a portfolio of myself.
